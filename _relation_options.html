<p>Sometimes we&#39;ll want to treat certain relations differently, the following options are available:</p>

<ul><li><code>manual_fetch</code>: By default BackbonORM will load related models whenever they are accessed. To turn off this behavior
and manually retrieve related models, pass <code>manual_fetch: true</code> as an option to the relation.</li><li><code>virtual</code>: By default, BackbonORM will ensure that changes to relations in memory are persisted to the respective store.
This may result in <code>hasOne</code>, <code>hasMany</code> and <code>manyToMany</code> relations being loaded in order to update their foreign keys.
To turn off this behavior and manually manage model relations, pass <code>virtual: true</code> as an option to the relation.
This is particularly useful when you wish to use models that do not have a store representation (e.g. they may be on
the client).</li><li><code>embed</code>: By default, relations are given their own storage representation (collection/table/endpoint). To indicate that
a model should only be saved as embedded json in a parent model pass <code>embed: true</code> as an option to the relation.</li></ul>
